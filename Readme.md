# Hangman

This is a small implementation of the game [hangman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangman_(game)), written in one single python script. 

The player is not able to lose the game and functionality is very limited. Game is played only in console, additionally it was only tested in a bash console.

I consider this as a small learning project to get my feet wet with python (and hopefully unittesting).

## future ideas (if I don't lose interest in this)
* difficulty setting, so player can lose
* make the game look nicer in console
* refactor for more unittest
